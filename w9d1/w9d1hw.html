<!-- Each script tag tells the browser to load and execute some JS code.
If the src attrib is given, the browser fetches the code. If the 
script tag has a body (called inline JS), it is treated as JS code and executed.
Inline JavaScript is considered poor style and is hard to keep organized,
so keep inline JS use to a minimum.

In this example, we would first fetch and execute the jQuery library from Google,
then run the inline alert code, then fetch and run our app.js file-->

<!-- Programs like browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Node.js
    JavaScript runtimes or environments. These environments expose functionality
    that our JS scripts can access through APIs.) -->

<!-- ex. Node.js lets us read files inside our scripts via the require("fs") module.
Similarly, we can use the browser's DOM API (for instance, document.getELementById("...");)
to find and modify HTML elements in a web page. -->

<!-- Neither FIle IO nor DOM manipulation are part of JS, per se.
Instead, these are functionalities provided by the environment
(NOde.js, web broswer), and accessed through a JavaScript API. -->
